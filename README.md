“Mise I’ve Seen” 

1. MVP  

Allow users to record a library of information about movies that they have seen or would like to see. The application should allow for users to pull data from the OMDb API. Each entry in a user's library should store general movie information (Director, Studio, year of release, title etc.) allow for a written review or notes, favoriting, and rating. 

2. Stretch 1 

Allow users to create a public/private profile to share their library entries. Would require users adding each other as friends to see a private profile while public profiles could be looked though via a list or “highly rated” page.  

3. Stretch 2 

Allow users to schedule watch parties of movies in their library. Users should be able to provide a location to arrive at or link to download/stream the film, and a time and date that the film will be shown. Other users should be able to RSVP and it show on the watch party listing.
