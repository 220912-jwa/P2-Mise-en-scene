“Mise I’ve Seen” 

1. MVP  

Allow users to record a library of information about movies that they have seen or would like to see. The application should allow for users to Insert raw information and pull data from the OMDb API. Each entry in a user's library should store general movie information (Director, Studio, year of release, title etc.) allow for a written review or notes, favoriting, and rating. 

2. Stretch 1 

Allow users to create a public/private profile to share their library entries. Would require users adding each other as friends to see a private profile while public profiles could be looked though via a list or “highly rated” page.  

3. Stretch 2 

Allow users to schedule watch parties of movies in their library. Users should be able to provide a location to arrive at or link to download/stream the film, and a time and date that the film will be shown. Other users should be able to RSVP and it show on the watch party listing.
